# simpleGrid

I want to build a simple Grid system with typed columns, paginated, sortable, with enterable cells 

02/27/2017 : Columns seems to be aligned thanls to mathematics !

02/26/2017 : French and english date support for sorting

02/25/2017 : Corrected aligment between header and body. Nice looking scrollBars, number of records in a new footer
