# simpleGrid

I want to build a simple Grid system with typed columns, paginated, sortable, with a modale to enter or modify data.

02/27/2017 : Columns seems to be aligned thanks to mathematics 
A modal is displayed on row click which automaticaly shows a form to modify the row content.
Delete + add new functionalities.

02/26/2017 : French and english date support for sorting

02/25/2017 : Corrected aligment between header and body. Nice looking scrollBars, number of records in a new footer

Here is a demo :
